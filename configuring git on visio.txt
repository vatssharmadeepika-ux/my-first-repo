In VS Code, the terminal is just your systemâ€™s command-line (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or bash).
So the command to **list files** depends on your OS:

* **Windows (PowerShell / Command Prompt):**

```bash
dir
```

* **Linux / macOS (bash, zsh, etc.):**

```bash
ls
```

ðŸ‘‰ For more details:

* To list all files (including hidden ones):

  ```bash
  ls -a   # Linux/macOS
  dir /a  # Windows
  ```

* To list with file details (size, permissions, modified date):

  ```bash
  ls -l   # Linux/macOS
  dir     # Windows already shows details
  ```

Do you want me to also show you **how to open the VS Code terminal in a specific project folder** so you can run these commands directly there?
